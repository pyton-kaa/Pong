# Pong
Tribute to the legendary simple video game by Atari

## How do you play?
There are two pads on either side of the screen, controlled with W/S and Up/Down arrows respectively. Player 1 starts the game by pressing Space. The ball moves from one side to another, bouncing at the top and bottom edges of the board. When it hits a pad, it turns bounces at an angle depending on the part of the pad that it hit. If the ball hits the right edge (instead of the right pad), Player 1 scores. If it hits the left edge, Player 2 scores. The game ends when one of the players has scored 11 points.
